remove all media 0.4 60 110*2
add 50ul of pbs
shake for 10s at 150rpm
take up 50ul pbs

add 50ul of pbs
shake for 10s at 150rpm
take up 50ul pbs

add 20 ul of tryple
incubate 5min

add 180ul of fresh media to new plate
same tips
add 180 ul of media 0.4 60 90*2
mix *3
take out 20 ul

put into new plate

shake at low speed 150rpm


---- potentially add fresh media first to new plate and then add the 20ul of cells afterwards.

for now 1 plate
0.4 zoffset with 60 speed is good

try reverse pipetting monday

--------

use magrack and heatblock as normal positions (it knows heatblock height) heatblock as pbs wash
use waste as liquid waste
minimise pipette usage
pbs wash inbetween old media pickup, do them all with one tips
can we get 4*plates for exchange
check reverse pippette accuracy
GRIP TIGHTER ON PICKUP from shaker - done use 9 and 2.5 for last two items of kit.json

-------------
run test
little bit slow on the waste dispense - done
tip wash is a bit slow too - done
remove second route rates?
CHECK shaking on PBS wash plates - seems ok?
it doest seem to do plate wash of first two old plates?  - TODO confirm
takes out from top two ok (and bottom two)
it unloads tips before start of second pbs wash cycle! - should be fixed
tip shake on final empty of tryple - done
optimise mix, look at last one. - done


---------
runtime for 4 plates:
take old media out: 4 min
finish plate wash with shaking and removing pbs cycle 1: 13 min
second cycle: 21:30
tryple addition: 23;30
adding fresh media to plates: 28:00
inoculation complete: 36:00
-----------
for pbs wash, reduce vol so can do it all in one aspiration (for 4 plates)
do more violent shake to get rid of droplets after throwing away old media
it definitely does not do first cycle of pbs plate wash right, it just puts it all into plate 3 , then dispenses nothing in plate 4. it takes it out fine of the top two after shaking. does the same in cycle 2. - done
inoc tips keep quite a lot of fresh media in the tips during the loading of it into new plates. this may be because of using dodgy reservoir and height for testing.
make sure when taking fresh media with inoc tips and dropping it in old plates, it does not touch the liquid. - done changed to 10
----------
second runtime for 4 plates:
take old media out: 4 min
finish plate wash with shaking and removing pbs cycle 1: 13 min
second cycle: 21 min
tryple addition:
adding fresh media to plates:
inoculation complete: 36 min
---------------
waste into deepwell plate: height 40, offset 2.8, doesn't touch the side, only droplet does.
---------------
change to 150 per old media operation
add boolean for each section
add config for pbs was
make shaking for pbs plate wash only shakle on last cycle. check reporting for this too.
put tryple back
check pbs is NOT put into waste - unnecessary
do popup of starting new media immediately after loading new media into new plates is done - no timer.
-------------------
media exchange:
supplements
supp1: plates: 1, 3, 5
etc.
